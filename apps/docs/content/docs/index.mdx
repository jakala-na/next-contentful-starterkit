## Setup repository

This project is a Github template, you can click [Use this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=next-contentful-starterkit&template_owner=jakala-na) to create a repository with a single init commit.
As soon as you have a repository, proceed with the setup.

1. Clone repository locally

```bash
git clone [repository url]
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

<Callout>
  You'll notice we use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as our package manager. We also use
  [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) to manage the monorepo. You'll notice all commands in docs will reflect
  that.
</Callout>

## Provision a Contentful space

To develop locally, you will want to connect to a Contentful instance that has the same data model as we use to develop, there are 2 ways to do that:

#### Provision Contentful Marketing Template space

You could get access to an existing space that follows Contentful Marketing Template content model, for example a colleague could share his space with you, or alternatively you can create a new one.
Contentful lets you create a new space from a template, but only for new accounts

Follow instructions [here](https://www.contentful.com/starter-templates/marketing-website/) to create a new space from a template.

<Callout>
  While this method works now because our template uses the same content model, we will add new content types in future
  and this option will be removed.
</Callout>

#### Provision a new space with our seed script

You can start from scratch and use our seed script to provision the content model and content.
First you will need to create an account and a space. You can follow first set of instructions [here](https://www.contentful.com/help/getting-started/contentful-101/)

After you have a space, let's login to Contentful CLI (it's installed as a dev dependency in the project)

```bash
pnpm exec contentful login
```

Once you are logged in, you can provision the new space with a new content model and content using our seed script:

```bash
pnpm --filter=marketing seed --space-id=[SPACE_ID]
```

## Configure environment variables

Once a space with content is provisioned, time to configure Next.js app to connect to it.

You will want to get a CDA and CPA API keys by using this [guide](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/authentication/#api-keys-in-the-contentful-web-app)

Create `.env.local` in `apps/marketing` directory of the repo with the following contents:

```bash
CONTENTFUL_SPACE=<space id>
CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_API=<delivery api key>
CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_API=<preview api key>
CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=master
CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_SECRET=<preview secret of your choice>

# Enable or disable Content Source Maps, see https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tools/vercel/content-source-maps-with-vercel/
CONTENTFUL_USE_CONTENT_SOURCE_MAPS=true
```

## Run Next.js Dev Server

```bash
turbo dev --filter=marketing
```

or run both Next.js and Storybook dev servers with:

```bash
turbo dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## What's next?

Now that you have a working setup, you can start exploring the code and building your own components and pages, here are some suggestions:

- Create a new UI component in `packages/ui` package
- Create a new content type in Contentful and integrate it in the project
- Explore out data-fetching choices and tweak them to your needs

You can learn more about those topics in dedicated sections of this documentation.
