title: Content Source Maps
---

Contentful has released a new live-preview API compatible Countent Source Maps spec, you can read more [here](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tools/vercel/content-source-maps-with-vercel/). This implementation enabled effortless inspector mode annotations in Live Preview, as well as full Edit Mode support on Vercel with [Content Link](https://vercel.com/changelog/content-link-can-now-be-used-with-contentful).

<Callout>
  Content Source Maps are only available on Contentful Premium plan. Vercel Content Link is only available on Vercel Pro
  and Enterprise plans.

### Opting out

If you wouldn't like to use content source maps, you are free to opt out
by:

1. Settings `CONTENTFUL_USE_CONTENT_SOURCE_MAPS=false` in .env.local or in Vercel environment variables
2. Removing `@contentSourceMaps` directive from GraphQL queries

<Callout>
  `@contentSourceMaps` ideally could be added conditionally, but gql.tada prevents any dynamic strings from being typed
  `TadaDocumentNode`. In future we will add the `@contentSourceMaps` directive to all queries in urql exchange.
